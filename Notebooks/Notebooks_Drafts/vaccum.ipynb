    "# VACUUM\n",
    "Vacuuming is a necessary aspect of maintaining a healthy and efficient PostgreSQL database. If you have autovacuuming configured, you usually don’t need to think about how and when to execute PostgreSQL VACUUMs at all—the whole process is automatically handled by the database. However, if you are constantly updating or deleting data, vacuuming schedules may not be able to keep up with the pace of those changes. Even worse, vacuum processes may not be running at all, which can lead to a number of side effects that negatively impact database performance and resource usage. Monitoring a few key PostgreSQL metrics and events will help you ensure that vacuum processes are proceeding as expected.\n",
