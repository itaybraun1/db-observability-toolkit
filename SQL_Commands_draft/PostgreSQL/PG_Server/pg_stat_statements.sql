-- JIT (only for pg15)
-- JIT: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/jit.html , 
-- Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation is the process of turning some form of interpreted program evaluation into a native program, and doing so at run time. For example, instead of using general-purpose code that can evaluate arbitrary SQL expressions to evaluate a particular SQL predicate like WHERE a.col = 3, it is possible to generate a function that is specific to that expression and can be natively executed by the CPU, yielding a speedup.
